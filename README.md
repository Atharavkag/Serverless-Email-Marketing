# TechTide ‚Äì Serverless Email Marketing

**TechTide** is a cloud-native, serverless email marketing solution designed to send personalized, HTML-based tech newsletters to subscribers on a weekly schedule. Built entirely using AWS services, TechTide ensures high availability, cost-efficiency, and automated email delivery ‚Äî without provisioning or managing servers.

---

## Project Overview

TechTide enables tech bloggers, communities, and organizations to send engaging newsletters without relying on third-party marketing platforms. With simple CSV-based subscriber management and a flexible HTML email template system, it's ideal for developers who want full control over email content, automation, and branding.

---

## Technologies Used

TechTide is built using the following AWS services:

- **Amazon S3**: Stores email templates, assets, and subscriber data (CSV).
- **AWS Lambda**: Core logic for rendering templates and sending emails.
- **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**: Handles email delivery.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Triggers Lambda weekly via cron expressions.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Logs and monitors Lambda performance.
- **CloudFormation (optional)**: Automates infrastructure setup.

## Architecture Flow

The system follows a clean event-driven architecture that runs autonomously once deployed.

**Flow Summary:**

1. Subscriber data is uploaded to Amazon S3 as a CSV file.
2. A weekly scheduled event triggers the Lambda function.
3. The Lambda function reads subscriber data and loads the HTML template from S3.
4. Emails are rendered with personalized content and sent via Amazon SES.
5. Logs and metrics are stored in CloudWatch for monitoring.

## üìä Lambda Monitoring
